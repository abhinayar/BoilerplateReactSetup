## Credits
Built following the Webpack tutorial by [Indrek Lasn](https://medium.com/@wesharehoodies/easy-guide-for-webpack-2-0-from-scratch-fe508a3ce44e). Full credits to the author of that tutorial. I'll probably add my own additions to this overtime but for now it's pretty much exactly following his in a format I can understand a bit better.
